# Customer-Data-Analysis-Tableau

This dataset contains information about customers, including their social security numbers, 
phone numbers, and locations. The data includes details such as the date the customer became 
a customer, their place name, county, city, state, zip code, region, username, and discount percentage.

# Objective

The objective of this project and the dataset is to provide information that can be used for customer analysis. 
By analyzing the data, it may be possible to identify patterns and trends related to customer behavior, 
preferences, and purchasing habits. This information can then be used to improve the customer experience, 
increase sales, and grow the business.
